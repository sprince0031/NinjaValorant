# Notes from practice (22/05/2024)
## Map: Ascent
## Comp used: Raze, Neon, Kay/0, Cypher, Clove
- Clove does not seem as useful to the team and has lesser impact when compared to what Omen can bring to the table. Omen's blind and TPs are way more useful to enable plays unlike Clove's kit which forces them to play in a style that just wants to take dry duels up front. 
  - **TL;DR**: Omen is just better than Clove. ***Play Omen***.
- Controller role requires precise timing with the smokes and more nuance with being able to play around this util. From observation of the match, there seems to be role issues that suit the playstyle of Higan when put into this role because of a lack of server time with controller agents. However, Higan is very competent at the Sentinel role and KJ is very viable on Ascent. Cypher too if Higan can demonstrate the ability to be versatile with his setups like Loki was during practice.
  - **TL;DR**: __Suggestion__ - **swap roles of Loki and Higan** where Loki plays Omen and Higan plays KJ/Cypher.
### Playing to the comp's strengths:
The team is not playing to the strengths of the comp. The following are some personal suggestions to make better use of the tools in your arsenal.
__Solo initiator Kay/0__
- Kay/0 is an initiator with decent flashes and a regenerating imprecise info tool in the form of his knife.
- The **best use of his flashes are to set the team up** for site takes and defensive set plays. Kay/0 flashing for himself is okay and can be good, but a solo flash is for clutches/ranked.
__Double duelist - Raze and Neon__
- There are two duelists. Raze with the superior gap closing/movement (dive) ability and Neon with good supportive entry abilities. 
- Always try to ensure **Raze enters site first with satchels** to break enemy cross-hair placements. 
  - With the above distraction, the **second entry layer** should be **Neon and Kay/0** with their flashes and stuns to capitalise on kills as enemies are trained on the Raze.
