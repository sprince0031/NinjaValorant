# Strengths
## Fast paced
- This comp leans into the aggressive set-play play style.
- Playing passively on defense is a disadvantage. We need to proactively re-clear areas of the map with time because we do not have good precise info gathering utility.
- The offensive site takes need to be oppressive to the point the opponents are forced to leave the site and play retake. 
	- If they are smart enough to play for retake, we need to recognise the change in their play pattern and start decreasing our util usage for our site takes and use them for post plant site defence. 
		- For example, in a standard site take, we might use both Kay/0 flashes and the Omen paranoia. That will work when sites are defended with 2-3 people and this enables us to get kills during the site take. However, when they play for retake, most of this will be wasted and we will have nothing while they have conserved all their utility for the retake.
		- **TL;DR**: ***Be reactionary to the information gathered about enemy positions in terms of util usage.*** Using a basic amount to gain space with no info is okay, but then look for signs of enemies to then take decisions on whether to use it or not.

# Weaknesses
## No active info gathering tools

## No real plan-b

## Post plant

## Lack of stall capability

# Opportunities
## Solo initiator Kay/0
- Kay/0 is an initiator with decent flashes and a regenerating imprecise info tool in the form of his knife.
- The **best use of his flashes are to set the team up** for site takes and defensive set plays. Kay/0 flashing for himself is okay and can be good, but a solo flash is for clutches/ranked.
## Double duelist - Raze and Neon
- There are two duelists. Raze with the superior gap closing/movement (dive) ability and Neon with good supportive entry abilities. 
- Always try to ensure **Raze enters site first with satchels** to break enemy cross-hair placements. 
  - With the above distraction, the **second entry layer** should be **Neon and Kay/0** with their flashes and stuns to capitalise on kills as enemies are trained on the Raze.
